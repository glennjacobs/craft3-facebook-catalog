# Facebook Product Catalog

Link your products with your Facebook page

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0 or later, and works out of the box when you have [Craft Commerce](http://plugins.craftcms.com/commerce) installed.

If you want to use the plugin without commerce and/or with regular entries, have a look at the [Twig functions](#twig-function) 

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:


## Twig function
If you want to use the plugin with regular entries, want to provide your own Element query or want to have mulitple feeds, have a look at these function.

### craft.facebookCatalog.render
The function takes an `ElementQuery` object (not the result, the query itself) and it applies

       {% set products = craft.products.limit(1) %}
       {{ craft.facebookCatalog.render(products) }}
